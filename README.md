This repository was just my experiments with vue and axios, when I was learning Vue. Now I use Nuxt.js and some UI frameworks for proper projects.

## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests

```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
